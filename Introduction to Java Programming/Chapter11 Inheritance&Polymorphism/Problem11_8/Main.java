// Problem 11.8 : Design a class Account as defined in 8.7, and also includes the following:
//                  - Name of the customer
//                  - A constructor that creates an account with the specified name, id, and balance
//                  - A datafield of type Arraylist where every element of this list is an instance of the
//                    Transaction class as defined in Figure 11.7. The list stores transactions for the accounts.
//                  - Method 'deposit' that deposits into the balance.
//                  - Method 'withdraw' that withdraws from the balance.
//                  - All other properties are the same.
